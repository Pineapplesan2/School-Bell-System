**KEVI School Bell System**

Bell System used by the school, 2018-Present

This project contains the original 2018 version created by Connor Millington, Cerys Lock and Cam Mattocks and the updated 2022 version created by Cam Mattocks.

In the 2022 version, the BellTimes.txt can be edited in the format it's currently in to add in additional times. However with the way the code is written, it is **STRONGLY** inadvisable to have over 30 different entries in this file.

In the 2.1 Version, the debug mode can be activated by typing in "debug menu" into the BellTimes.txt file, once it's loaded into memory it will load up the debug window. Be sure to delete this from the text file once you're done as the debug window pauses the program when it's open and will keep on loading if it's present in the text file.

The recommended restart time on the program is once a month, after which, if not restarted, efficiency may start to noticeably reduce and lag to the system the program is running on may gradually increase. As the intended use of this program is in a school, a restart every half term should suffice, but this requires further testing.
